class Agent(object):
    """An agent is a class whose instances follow a standard protocol for
    running and for communicating with other agents.

    Agents may or may not run in their own thread.

    From the class's point of view, execution enters an Agent object in two
    places.
    
    First, the run() method may be used for asynchronous tasks. The run method
    should be a python generator, and it must "yield" once in a while to
    cooperatively yield execution to tasks that may be running in the same
    thread.

    Second, execution may enter any method of the object called externally.
    This method is executed in the caller's thread by default. If, however, the
    method is decorated with @Agent.queued, the method call will be queued and
    run asynchronously from the caller's point of view. The method will be
    executed as one of the tasks that happens while run() is yielded, and run
    in the agent's thread.

    From an external point of view, usage depends on whether the Agent is to
    run in its own thread.

    If the agent is to have its own thread, the caller must make an instance
    and then call start_threaded(). This will launch a thread to handle the
    Agent's run() method as well as asynchronous callbacks.

    If the agent is not to have its own thread, the caller must call the
    agent's run() method to get the generator object, and then call its next()
    method periodically.
    
    If the agent is to become the master of the current thread, the caller can
    just call start(), which does not return.
